    "content": "While data science uses a combination of statistical tools, methods, and technology to extract insights from data, artificial intelligence (AI) goes beyond this process by utilizing data to solve cognitive problems related to human intelligence, such as pattern recognition and learning. With that said, both data science and artificial intelligence play an important role in many modern workplaces.",

In the midst of this are the terms - AI, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc. In this post, I offer perspective on two of these terms - AI and Data Science, and what they (commonly) mean relative to each other. In the same way that AI is an umbrella term for intelligence, Data Science is an umbrella term for insights from data. Does AI need Data Science? As such, some advanced AIs do not necessarily require classic data science. Does Data Science need AI? However, it is possible to use AI to learn insights from data that are not visible with simple data science techniques.",
