# Web-Research-Agent

How I Built It
This project was crafted as a dual-agent AI research assistant, built from scratch using cutting-edge tools from the LangChain ecosystem. Here's how I developed it:

üîç Custom Web Scraping Agent (Tavily): I integrated the Tavily API to fetch structured and relevant web content for any user-defined query. The agent dynamically adjusts search breadth based on the depth of research selected.

üß† LLM-Powered Drafting Agent (OpenRouter): I built a powerful drafting module using OpenRouter‚Äôs Dolphin model via LangChain. It transforms raw research into structured summaries with sections like Key Findings, Analysis, and Conclusion ‚Äî customizable in tone, length, citation style, and language.

üîÑ LangGraph Workflow Pipeline: Using LangGraph, I orchestrated a robust state-based workflow that passes data between agents in a logical sequence, supporting both quick overviews and deep-dive research papers.

üñ•Ô∏è Interactive UI with Streamlit: The front end was developed in Streamlit with rich UI features, including a dark theme, sidebar settings, PDF/Word export, and real-time API status monitoring.

üíæ Caching & Retry Handling: I implemented joblib caching and built-in retry logic (using tenacity) to enhance performance and fault tolerance during API interactions.

üìÑ Multi-Format Report Generator: Leveraging ReportLab and python-docx, I enabled export to PDF, Word, Markdown, and plain text, maintaining proper academic formatting with pagination, references, and styles.

‚ú® User-Centric Enhancements: From writing-style previews to responsive download options and inline citation previews, I focused on creating a smooth, informative user experience.

# Web Research Agent

## Overview

A dual-agent system for deep research, powered by OpenAI and Tavily for web crawling and OpenRouter for drafting structured summaries. Built using LangChain, LangGraph, and Streamlit for a seamless and interactive research experience.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sureshsharmah/Web-Research-Agent
    cd Web-Research-Agent
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

      Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. The `requirements.txt` file includes:
   - `langchain-openai`
   - `langchain`
   - `langgraph`
   - `streamlit`
   - `tavily-python`
   - `requests`
   - `tenacity`
   - `python-dotenv`
   - `python-docx`
   - `reportlab`
   - `joblib`


   - Additional dependencies for document processing

3. Create a `.env` file with API keys:

      ```bash
      OPEN_API_KEY=your_open_api_key
      TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key
      OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
      ```
      - Obtained a OpenAPI key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)
      - Obtain a Tavily API key from [Tavily](https://tavily.com) (free tier available).
      - Obtain an OpenRouter API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (uses the free models, can be altered as per preference).

4. Run the app locally:

      ```streamlit run app.py```

## Features

- **Dual-Agent System**:
  - **Research Agent**: Fetches data from the web using Tavily, returning structured results (title, content, URL).
  - **Draft Agent**: Generates structured summaries with sections: Research Summary, Key Findings, Analysis, and Conclusion, using LLM model.
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Writing styles (Academic, Casual, Technical, etc.)
  - Citation formats (APA, MLA, IEEE)
  - Target word count
  - Multiple output formats (PDF, Word, Markdown, Text)
- **Structured Summaries**: Outputs summaries with clear sections (Research Summary, Key Findings, Analysis, Conclusion) for readability.
- **PDF Report Download**: Allows users to download a PDF report containing the query, research data, and structured summary, with proper text wrapping and multi-page support.
- **Retry Logic**: Handles API failures with `tenacity`, retrying up to 3 times with a 2-second delay.
- **OpenRouter Status**: Displays real-time API status in the sidebar, alerting users if OpenRouter is unavailable.
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows a progress bar during research and drafting for better user experience.
- **User Feedback**: Includes a feedback form in the sidebar to collect user suggestions.
- **Custom Styling**: Features high-contrast colors, proper spacing, and readable typography for an enhanced UI.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Streamlit.
